I've made an object home of class Home, which consists of different pets. Each pet has unique characteristics such as name, breed, weight, age and greeting. Then i've accomplished sorting of all pets in home by age. Also i have added function which determines whether are two pets friends or not. And eventually, i've created function which decides, based on the greeting, whether is pet pollite or not. If greeting is "Hello" then pet is pollite, in other cases â€” not. 
To open my project, import main.cpp, Header.h and functions.cpp to IDE, build and then run main.cpp file.
