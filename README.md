I`ve made an object home of class Home, which consists of different pets. Each pet has unique characteristics such as name, breed, weight, age and greeting. Than i`ve accomplished sorting of all pets in home by age. Also i have added function which determines whether are two pets friends or not. And eventually, i`ve created function which decides, based on the greeting, wheather is pet polite or not. If greeting is "Hello" then pet is pollite, in other cases â€” not. 
To open my project, import main.cpp, Header.h and functions.cpp to IDE, build and then run main.cpp file.
